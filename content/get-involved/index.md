<p>Anyone can contribute to the NavCoin protocol. The software is free and open-source. If you'd like to pitch in on existing projects take a look at the Roadmap to find one that interests you, or you could start a project of your own. You can also contribute by reviewing pull requests or writing patches.</p>
<p>The self-documented code in GitHub is a great place to get familiar with NavCoin, or you can join the discussion on the NavCoin Discord. You'll find that the NavCoin developer community is active and supportive. Discord is the place for meeting and chatting with other devs, and formal development discussion for each project takes place on GitHub. </p>

<p>The NavCoin brand bible collates the NavCoin Core Media and Content Creators suggestions on how to create a consistent look and feel for promotional material and brand assets. It covers typefaces and how to use them, sets out a colour palate, and gives useful tips on how to create visuals and write with the NavCoin tone of voice. It’s hoped that having these guidelines will make it easier for you to get started on creating your own content for NavCoin.</p>
