A major focus of the past few weeks for NavCoin Core has been creating a range of tools and resources to empower the NavCoin community to be confident contributors within the NavCoin ecosystem.

* The “Get Involved” page on the NavHub website has been redesigned, and a set of brand guidelines have been released.  
* Developer and Content Creator manifestos that clarify roles and responsibilities are almost ready to share. 
* Guides for onboarding merchants and charities will be available soon. 
* Work is progressing on better developer documentation for the NavCoin protocol.
* The Community Fund launches in the near future. 

### What’s happening in the community.

It’s the Sakdeniz show this week. He created these awesome animations using Windows Movie Maker, and is happy for everyone in the NavCoin community to use them on social media. Click the ‘Share’ tab under the video player window to get an embeddable link to the video. Check them out and be inspired.

### Technical updates

NavPay version 4.1 has now been released. After a last minute refinement to ensure the release went smoothly, the new wallet is ready to download. Read more about at the blog post https://navhub.org/news/2018/05/navpay-release/ or download it here 
https://navcoin.org/navpay/

The NavCoin Core protocol 4.2 is almost ready to go. This is a big update, so look out for a blog post in the near future which will outline the key changes you need to be aware of. 

NAV is starting to accumulate in the NavCoin Community Fund, and a tutorial on how to use Github and contribute to projects being built on the NavCoin protocol is almost ready.

As part of the redesign process for NavCoin.org the full wallet downloads laundry list has been added back to navcoin.org/downloads, plus a new content management system (CMS) for NavCoin.org site Navhub.org is being created. The CMS aims to make it easy for anyone to add content without needing to install any development tools - it’s a login tool based on GitHub, and provides a tidy interface to add in community news easily.

The new NavCoin Paper Wallet version was added to paper.navcoin.org. A Paper Wallet is great option for cold storage offline or giving NavCoin as a gift. You can view the links to the paper wallets on the downloads page below

### Content and media.
After input from numerous community members the new community website domain name has been selected. The new URL is navhub.org and it’s hoped that this will help remove confusion between NavHub’s community purpose and the more technical, developer focused website at navcoin.org

The NavCoin core content creators also released their brand guidelines or ‘the brand bible’ was published last week. It’s aimed at enabling the community to create their own NavCoin marketing material. It’s full of useful tips and examples to make it easier to create a consistent look and feel for your work on NavCoin, without needing to reinvent the wheel. The next stage for this is to build an asset library to house marketing assets, that anyone can contribute to. By making all them simple to find, it will be easier than ever to share and post about NavCoin on social media.
