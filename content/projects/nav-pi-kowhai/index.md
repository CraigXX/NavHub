    <p>After the success of the NavPi project, NavCore have decided to fully re-engineer the NavPi from the ground up to make it even better and easier to use. </p>

    <p>The user experience flow below maps out the intended features of the Kowhai release. This flow wireframe doesnâ€™t reflect what the design will look like, but instead it represents the features that the initial software will launch with and where they will sit within the application.</p>
