NavCoin and it’s eco-system of projects are free open source software. If you want to contribute to any of these projects you can via the [NavCoin GitHub](https://github.com/NAVCoin) repositories. If you’re working on your own NavCoin project, announce it to the community on the [NavCoin Discord](https://discord.gg/y4Vu9jw) and we’ll add it to the [roadmap](/roadmap)!

## NavCoin
