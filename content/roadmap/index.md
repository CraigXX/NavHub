NavCoin and its eco-system of projects are all open source. If you want to contribute to any of these projects you can via the [NavCoin GitHub](https://github.com/NAVCoin) repositories. If you’re working on your own NavCoin project, announce it to the community on the [NavCoin Discord](https://discord.gg/y4Vu9jw) and we’ll add it to the [roadmap](/roadmap)!

## NavCoin
Cryptocurrencies are complicated, and it’s NavCoin’s mission to change that. As a community, we are striving to make NavCoin the most usable cryptocurrency on the planet.

NavCoin’s project [roadmap](/roadmap) continues that journey. Together we are laying the foundation for NavCoin to be an industry-leading cryptocurrency, by building better money.
